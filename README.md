React Redux Kit is a react boilerplate application for building web apps using react, material-ui, redux, saga middleware, react-router and redux-persist. This kit serves as a starting point for creating complex single page apps for starters and helps to keep the best practices.

## App Layout

Before you start, take a moment to see how the project structure looks like:

```
.
├── /node_modules/              # 3rd-party libraries and utilities
├── /public/
├── /src/
│   ├── /app-core/              # Data store and side effects - redux, selectors saga middleware
│   ├── /app-ui/                # UI components and pages - React, material-ui
│   ├── /app-web/               # Containers and app routing - react-router, data props to UI

├── .eslintignore               # Linting ignore definitions
├── .eslintrc	                # Linting rules
├── .prettierrc	                # Prettier rules
├── package.json                # Reference for libraries and dependencies
